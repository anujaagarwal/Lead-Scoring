# What is Lead-Scoring?
Marketing officers work really hard to pitch their product or services, only to attract high volumes of leads. In fact, inbound marketing efforts are solely focused on attracting leads that may become customers in time. Or to rephrase that, attracting strong leads that intend to offer good business and not customers who are just beginning to look around. The challenge, therefore, is to separate these good-quality leads from the others. That’s precisely where lead scoring comes in. And lead scoring without data analytics is a myth!

Lead scoring ranks a prospect or lead against certain parameters to gauge their potential of converting into a future customer. Lead scoring heavily relies on customer related data collected from various sources, in order to rank a prospect. Data analytics helps make sense of these huge mounds of data. Data analytics helps draw conclusions from the information available to customers. Here’s how data analytics helps you increase lead scoring.
